Everything needed to turn an infrared video of the BUG CW calorimeter into an estimate of the incident power density.

The main objects in here are the BUGFoilCalorimeter and BUGFoilPair classes, which work together to recognise foil
pairs in the infrared images, generate the transform from pixels to absolute position in mm, and extract the temperature
delta for conversion into power density.

Quantities computed from fits, including the power density, are wrapped into ufloats or arrays thereof from the
uncertainties package, for inclusion of their estimated uncertainty.

    """Container for extracting and containing information from an IR movie of the CW calorimeter at BUG

    Call with a movie (list() of images) taken using the IR camera looking at the back side of the CW Calorimeter
    at BUG and the class instance will attempt to recognise the foils heated by the beam, using the hottest overall
    image. If there are enough to work with, it will build a transform from pixel space to position (in mm) relative
    to the hottest foil on the calorimeter. If it can recognise the thermocouples in the image, the positioning will
    be made relative to the centre of the calorimeter.

    Foil pairs (BUGFoilPair objects) are stored in a 2D array representing their actual positions on the calorimeter.
    Information about the foils can either be extracted from BUGFoilCalorimeter.foil_array[ii, jj] directly, or by
    using the helper functions.

    Selected Methods
    -------
    list_of_foil_values(attribute: str, valid_only: bool = False)
        Returns a flat list of the provided attribute extracted from each of the foil pairs.
    array_of_foil_values(attribute: str)
        Returns an array of the provided attribute extracted from each of the foil pairs. Depending on the type of
        value contained in the attribute, the returned array might be a 2D array of scalars, a 2D array of objects,
        or an ndarray where the first two indices represent the 2D arrangement of foil pairs.

    Selected Attributes
    -------------------
    valid_foils: (N, M) array of BUGFoilPair
        A flattened array of just the foils which have been found on the calorimeter. This is not 2D, as such an array
        might be sparse.
    foil_positions_mm: (N, M, 2) array
        The coordinates of the measurement location of each foil pair, relative to the estimated centre of the
        calorimeter. The origin may be off by some multiple of the distance between foil pairs, depending if an
        absolute position has been found via the thermocouples.
    foil_positions_pix: (N, M, 2) array
        The foil measurement locations translated into pixel coordinates
    foil_array_axes: tuple((M,) array, (N,) array)
        The x and y axes of the foil array. Be aware these correspond to the image orientation, not the calorimeter
        orientation!
    power_density: tuple((M, N) array, (N,) array, (M,) array)
        The calculated steady state power density for this calorimeter movie. The arrays, in order, are power density
        in MW per mÂ², and the x and y axes in mm. These arrays are oriented as if one were observing the calorimeter
        from the FRONT. A motion of the beam toward positive x would be a deflection to the right.
    thermocouple_time_traces: pd.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing time traces of the temperatures at the locations given in THERMOCOUPLE_POSITIONS_MM.
    image_blur: ufloat
        The estimate blurryness of the sample image, corresponding to a general uncertainty (in units of pixels)

    """A single pair of hot/cold foil fingers from which a power density can be calculated

    This object serves a number of intertwined purposes that are isolated to each foil pair:
        - Estimation/fitting of finger locations from a sample image
        - Providing spatial positioning of features relative to a given point
        - Finding a power density from time traces of temperature of requested locations

    Instances may be initialised with or without a sample image corresponding to the area of the total frame that was
    found to match the template. If one is provided, then an attempt is made to locate the centres of the hot and cold
    fingers. If the 'corner' is provided, then it is able to return these as positions relative to the origin of the
    whole image - 'corner' should be the corner of the sample image that is closest to the origin.

    Attribute handling is changed so that mixtures of instances with and without sample images can be manipulated in
    arrays without throwing errors. Attributes for which setters and getters are used (via the @property decorator), and
    would normally return a scalar or a vector of known size, will return nans instead if these values are not set.
    Other attributes will return None.

    The local origin for positions given in mm is a point chosen such that the foils lie on a regular 2D grid,
    regardless of whether their template was flipped or not. Instances of this class should be provided with a value for
    'relative_offset_mm', which is the location of their local origin relative to the origin of the whole calorimeter.
    Other positions are returned with this offset included, so that they can be correctly placed on the calorimeter.

        The position of this instance relative to the origin of the calorimeter.

    fitted_temperature_delta: float

    This function returns a time trace of an object subject to a heating effect limited in time. The heat up and cool
    down phases are both assumed to happen exponentially, though with individual time constants. Before t_on, the object
    has a constant temperature 'offset'. At t = t_on, it starts heating toward a 'target_temperature' with time constant
    'tau_on'. After another 'on_time' of time-units, the heating stops and the object cools back down towards 'offset'
    with a time constant 'tau_off'.

    The equation during the on-time is:
        T(t) = offset + target_temperature*(1 - exp( - tau_on * (t - t_on)))
